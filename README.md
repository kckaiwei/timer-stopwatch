# timer-stopwatch

Timer-Stopwatch is a module for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/ "Foundry VTT") which adds a timer/stopwatch 
functionality

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress and has not been fully released, so some features will not work.

This is also my first module from scratch, so I've left ample documentation for anyone else trying to figure out the
inner workings of FoundryVTT

## Installation

Create a folder called `timer-stopwatch` in your `modules` folder in FoundryVTT, and copy the contents of this repo in.

Until I get a full release and get added into the official installation process, this will have to do.
